A key component of drug discovery is identifying compounds that will disrupt the network of proteins that relate to a disease. A previous study found evidence that using information about proteins, particularly relating to the amino acid sequences, improved bioactivity predictions. Our aim is to understand how far this result might be generalised and whether we can further improve performance.
